Day 1 Notes

What worked:
Executing code in the terminal worked and made sense to me, connecting files and terminal.

What was confusing:
Why hello.py didn't work for the first time, turns out you just need to enter the folder
in the terminal first.

What I learned:
I learned and remembered how to execute code, I recalled how to do input and print,
if else.

Next thing to learn tomorrow:
We'll see!
