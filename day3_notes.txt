Day 3 Notes

New concepts today:
- for loops + range()
- while loops
- break and continue
- try/except (ValueError)
- importing modules (random)
- using state variables (attempts, won, quit_game)

What clicked for me:
Just revisited old learnt stuff, the game was fun.

What I’m still unsure about:
I want to practice more instead of just going over theory.

One thing I can now build that I couldn’t before:
Loops. Definitely loops.
