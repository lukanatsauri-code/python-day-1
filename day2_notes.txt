Day 2 Notes

What I practiced:
- types (str vs int/float)
- converting input with int() and float()
- if / elif / else
- reading and fixing errors (TypeError, NameError, ValueError)

What confused me:
I don't know, nothing I guess!

What I can do now that I couldn't yesterday:
Work with inputs and independently create 

One thing to improve tomorrow:
Just keep improving.
